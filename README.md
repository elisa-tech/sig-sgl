# ELISA Space Grade Linux Special Interests Group

The goal of the group is to advance space technology innovation and competitiveness by developing a common Linux distribution that can be used in space applications, ready for the challenges of deep space, often long lifespan robotic or human-based missions. The nature of space missions brings many challenges, from development to deployment there are multiple considerations that need to be considered. Furthermore this group is the initial step towards creating an ecosystem of supported platforms and a community that benefits from them, and also from the open source nature of the project.
